The [ArduinoJSON library](https://arduinojson.org/) included here works under a MIT License (check the website for more info).

The [MD5 library](https://github.com/tzikis/ArduinoMD5) included here works under whatever License the people who made it want (by the time I'm writting these lines there's no reference on any specific license on their repo, so no idea).

The rest of it (all of my code - obviously without the external libraries such as the [ESP8266Wifi](https://esp8266-arduino.readthedocs.io/en/latest/esp8266wifi/readme.html) or the [Adafruit SSD1306](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306) is free and it should work under an [UNLICENSE](http://unlicense.org).
